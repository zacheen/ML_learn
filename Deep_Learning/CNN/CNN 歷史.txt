ConvNet ??

OverFeat 某一種經典的 CNN 架構
    OverFeat adopted a strategy similar to early neural network face detectors by applying a ConvNet as a "sliding window detector" on an image pyramid.
R-CNN
    R-CNN adopted a "region proposal-based" strategy in which each proposal was scale-normalized before classifying with a ConvNet
SPPnet
    應該是想要取代 R-CNN
    優點好像是比 R-CNN 更快
Fast R-CNN
Faster R-CNN
    advocate using features computed from a single scale, because it offers a good trade-off between accuracy and speed
    但是 Multi-scale detection, however, still performs better, especially for small objects.
