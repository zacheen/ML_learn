Agent taking reasonable actions based on hand-made rules,
i.e. go to right if leaning towards left, vice versa.

Observation space: [position of cart, velocity of cart, angle of pole, rotation rate of pole]
Action space: [moving cart to left, moving cart to right]

Note that good agents learn the policies by themselves,
and don't need to know the meaning of the observations.
